### Sample question about missing data:
1. Describe an instance where you thought your dataset was complete, but it turned out to have missing data. How did you know there was missing data
#### Answer: 
One time the accounting team handed me last quarter’s expense reports. When I looked at the data, it kept showing #N/A for all the team members from a certain team,
so I knew that their data was missing.
It is a real-life scenario that someone might have at their job.
They tried to get answers out of their data and couldn’t, meaning they understood data was missing.
They identified exactly what data was missing

2.What problems arose when you had missing data?
#### Answer
Since I didn’t have information on a couple of teams, I couldn’t give an accurate report on our expenses for a budget meeting.
