### Project 1: ( Real estate trust analysis) 

In this project, you will analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock.

Using financial statistics and NumPy you will analyze two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.

The time period for analysis we will be using is Jan 1 2018 to Dec 31 2018. The REIT data for SBRA (SBRA.csv) and EQR (EQR.csv) can be found in the same folder as this file.

### Project 2: (Mean Variance Optimization)

You're an investment analyst at a large fund. You specialize in calculating efficient frontiers and selecting assets for portfolios.

In this project, you will do the following:
1. Follow the steps to calculate the efficient frontier of a portfolio with five assets.
2. See how two additional assets affect the efficient frontier.
3. Use the covariance matrix and expected returns from ten assets to select the five assets that produce the best efficient frontier.
